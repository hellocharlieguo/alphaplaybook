The reframe is sharper than a re-entry, though. Memory is now the center of the thesis: “I think memory is the most important part of the AI trade,” with DRAM pricing rising across DDR3/4/5 and customers signing long-term contracts. The new selection filter is the step-up function — he is hunting names that have not yet repriced their earnings inflection, because once a company beats by only a little (his example: Nvidia post-2024) you still compound ~25% a year but you never get back to 60–70%. The regime warning is the other half: Micron, Samsung and ASML all blew away numbers and traded lower, so “it is now equally possible for companies to underwhelm as it is for them to overwhelm.” He maps the correction at a 30–60% retracement, would not be surprised by a tag of the 50-day and a turn, and explicitly does not expect a V-bounce.`,

He is acting on it inside his own book, flagging removals from the 100-name thematic portfolio: names that genuinely benefit from AI but “will be disrupted sooner than what people think.” The Eli Lilly anchor is untouched by any of this — the caution is aimed at the software-and-services middle, not at pharma.`,

The mechanism is the agent thesis closing the loop — “the rise of agents leads to more crypto,” and “Bitcoin is the collateral of the future,” which he says he will build his next writing and YouTube work around.

His read is that this is what everything looks like as it gets tokenized and momentum capital compresses the timescale — not a thesis break.
